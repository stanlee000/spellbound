## 🌟 Why Spellbound?

As someone who didn't grow up speaking English, writing for work and social media used to mean bouncing between grammar checkers, style tools, and translation apps (Grammarly, Hemingway, Google Translate). It was a mess and slowed me down, especially in today's fast-paced, multinational world where you constantly need to live in different countries and switch languages.

One day, after yet another round of app-switching, I thought, "Why isn't there one tool that just does it all?" That’s why I built Spellbound—a simple app that sits in your tray and helps with grammar, style, and translations in seconds. Just highlight & copy your text, hit ```Cmd+Shift+C```, and you’re set.

It started as my personal fix, but now I'm excited to share it with anyone who wants to write better and faster, no matter what language you're working in. And yep, I used Spellbound to write this :)
